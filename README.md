Fundamentals of Data Analytics project 2020

### Project overview
This project performs and explains simple linear regression using Python on the `powerproduction` data set, a bivariate data set conatining the variables *power* and *speed*. The ultimate goal is to build a model which accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values. 


### In this repositry

##### jupyter notebook
Included in this repository is a jupyter notebook which details the procedure undertaken to build the final predictive model. It follows a step by step approach, exploring a numnber of topics and concepts in the process including:
* Preliminary data analysis
* Simple linear regression
* Polynomial regression
* Outliers
* Train-test-split procedure
* Evaluation metrics

On establishing that a simple linear regression model does not make sufficiently accurate predictions, a polynomial regression predictive model is applied.
